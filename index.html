<h1>The Leading Paths of Technology</h1>
<p>In so many ways, <strong><em>technology</em></strong> has been such a force of change in our society, that it has become something very much ubiquitous. From the invention of fire, to the ability to exlpore other planets in our own Solar System - technology is very much a human achievement, that at times straddles
our own collective imaginations. In our current technological evolutionary stage, we are perhaps still children learning our way through this path. But as a child, it learns by trail and error. As an elder, wisdom takes over and becomes a lot more mature and wise. Thus technology in itself will reach a plateau in which humans will be able to grasp it at its full potential - in time. Milestones that we weren't able to <strong><em>imagine</em></strong> beforehand.
